# Multi-Agent Gemini System

A multi-agent AI system built using **Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and **Gemini LLM**, demonstrating a sequential workflow for research and summarization tasks.

This project shows how specialized agents can collaborate to solve complex problems:  
- **Research Agent:** Collects relevant information on a given topic using Google Search.  
- **Summarizer Agent:** Summarizes the collected research into a concise bulleted list.
